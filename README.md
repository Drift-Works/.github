# DriftWorks

**Intelligent systems for complex environments.**

We build autonomous products that observe, understand, and respond to the environments they operate in — from live audiences to network infrastructure to security landscapes.

Based in New York City. Building at [driftworks.nyc](https://driftworks.nyc).

### How We Build

Every product follows the same principles: observe before acting, document everything, build to last. We maintain enterprise-grade standards from day one — not because we have to, but because the work deserves it.

Our repositories include comprehensive governance documentation, decision logs, and operational procedures. Code is reviewed by independent agents. Security is treated as a brand asset, not an afterthought.
